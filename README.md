# Graph-plotter
Plot any function of $x$ on a $xy$ plane, zoom in/out and check the coordinates.  
To use common math functions like $sin(x)$, add `Math.` in front of the function e.g. `Math.sin(x)`

TODO:
- [x] plot multiple plots on the same graph
- [ ] zoom in/out using mouse scroll wheel
- [ ] pan the graph
- [ ] checkEquation should have a better parser for `Math.<functions>`. `Math.` should not have to be added
- [ ] handle asymptotes as moveTo() joins the plot in that case. Same with non-continous functions
